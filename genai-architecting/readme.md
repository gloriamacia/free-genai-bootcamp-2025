# **AI Infrastructure & GenAI Strategy for Language Learning App**  

## **1. Business Requirements**  

The company is developing an **AI-powered language learning app** to teach **Catalan to English speakers**. The goal is to create **engaging, AI-driven exercises and games** while maintaining **cost efficiency** through a **frugal AWS-based architecture** with **serverless** where possible.  

### **GenAI Strategy**  
- **Prioritize Anthropic Claude** on **AWS Bedrock** for seamless integration.  
- **Test OpenAI models** to compare performance before committing.  
- **Evaluate open-source models like DeepSeek** as a flexible, cost-effective alternative.  
- **Ensure traceability** by using models with **transparent training data** to **avoid copyright risks**.  

### **Target Audience**  
- **Students and language learners** seeking interactive **AI-driven learning**.  
- Primarily **urban users** with stable internet access.

## **2. Functional Requirements**  

### **Core AI Features**  
- **AI-Generated Content**:  
  - **Catalan-English translations, conversations, and grammar exercises**.  
  - **Adaptive learning paths** based on user progress.  

- **Gamification & Personalization**:  
  - **Quizzes, challenges, and AI-driven feedback**.  

- **Multi-Platform Accessibility**:  
  - **Web & mobile support** for ease of use.  

- **Data Security & Compliance**:  
  - **Ensure GDPR compliance** and **secure learning material storage**.  

### **Technical Strategy**
