    - BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the article markers, the cells are missing gender information
    - BAD: the beginner explanation is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide conjugated forms of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much, we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] hi [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

    | English | Catalan | Type |
    | bear    | ós      | noun |
    | door    | porta   | noun |
    | garbage | escombraries | noun |
    | leave   | deixar  | verb |

    Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Bears are at the door" and "did you leave the garbage out?".
    For the first clause, we can use either "ser" or "estar" to indicate location. We'll need to figure out which one is appropriate.
    For the second clause, we need to use the past tense of "deixar". We'll need to determine which past tense form to use.

    Here's a possible sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb] 
    [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Your turn! Can you try to fill in the blanks using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided?

    - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediately
    - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence structure with proper Catalan elements (hi, articles)
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tenses or conjugations

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Catalan | Type |
    |------|---------|------|
    | bear | ós (m.) | noun with article (el/els) |
    | door | porta (f.) | noun with article (la) |
    | garbage | escombraries (f.pl) | noun with article (les) |
    | to be (location) | estar | verb |
    | to leave | deixar | regular -ar verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] hi [Verb] [Subject], [Verb-past] [Object]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part uses 'hi' with location
    - The second part asks about a past action
    - Articles must agree in gender and number

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marker 'hi'
    - ask clues about connecting two clauses
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
